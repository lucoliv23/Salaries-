- Exploratory analysis of the source dataset 🔍
- Creation of a Machine Learning model for salary prediction 💰
- Performance optimization of the model 📈

# Context
Within this dataset are the salaries of several Data Science Fields in the Data Science Domain. 
The goal is to describe the characteristics of the data and then build 
a model that allows us to identify what the wage is according to different patterns identified earlier.

# Data Dictionary
Data Science Job Salaries Dataset contains 11 columns, each are:

- work_year: The year the salary was paid.
